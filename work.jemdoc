== Computer science research-y

- (2019) (Planned submission to ACL 2020) I'm currently working on my undergraduate thesis with Prof. [https://cs.brown.edu/people/epavlick/ Ellie Pavlick], tentatively titled "When do neural models learn heuristics?" We're studying (empirically for now) the tipping point when models switch from (1) learning simple rules and memorizing exceptions to those rules, to (2) learning more complex and generalizable rules. I received an Undergraduate Thesis and Research Award (UTRA) from Brown to work on this project. We submitted an extended abstract (*[documents/pdfs/abstract.pdf here]*) to the [https://www.nyas.org/events/2019/natural-language-dialog-and-speech-nds-symposium/ Natural Language, Dialog and Speech (NDS) Symposium] at the New York Academy of Sciences.

- (2019) I'm working with Profs. [https://cs.brown.edu/people/epavlick/ Ellie Pavlick] and [https://www.brown.edu/academics/cognitive-linguistic-psychological-sciences/people/faculty/roman-feiman Roman Feiman] on simulating implicature-like phenomena with neural networks (including [https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805 BERT]). We're interested in whether neural networks can predict the alternatives that listeners generate in the [https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.06807 Rational Speech Acts (RSA) model]. An in-progress repository with these models is *[https://github.com/rohjha/examples here]*.

- (2018-2019) As part of a graduate algorithms seminar with [http://cs.brown.edu/~pvaliant/ Prof. Paul Valiant], I presented "Probabilistic encryption" by Goldwasser and Micali (with Miranda Christ and Noah Picard) and "Undirected connectivity in log-space" by Reingold (with Miranda Christ and [https://sdimp.github.io/ Shivam Nadimpalli]) (slides *[documents/pdfs/pres.pdf here]*). Miranda Christ and I also wrote summaries of "Hardness vs. randomness" by Nisan and Wigderson (*[documents/pdfs/summary1.pdf here]*) and Dinur's proof of the PCP theorem (*[documents/pdfs/summary2.pdf here]*), and we previously presented "Primes in P" by Agarwal, Kayal, and Saxena.

- (2018) Varun Mathur and I built a model (code *[https://github.com/vrnmthr/emocontext here]*) and wrote a short paper (*[documents/pdfs/paper.pdf here]*) for the EmoContext task at SemEval 2019, as part of a graduate course with Prof. [https://cs.brown.edu/people/epavlick/ Ellie Pavlick].

== Miscellaneous

- (2018) I wrote much of the battery charging logic (*[https://github.com/BrownSpaceEngineering/EQUiSatOS/blob/master/EQUiSatOS/EQUiSatOS/src/rtos_tasks/battery_charging_task.c here]*) for [https://brownspace.org/equisat/ EQUiSat], the second-cheapest satellite in history and Rhode Island's first satellite. EQUiSat is currently in orbit and is alive and well.

- (2018) I TA'd the first iteration of [https://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci0111/ "Computing Foundations: Data"] with [https://cs.brown.edu/~kfisler/ Prof. Kathi Fisler]. I had the privilege of designing course content, including labs and daily drills.

- (2018) I added "Daily Digest" notifications to [https://appcenter.ms/ App Center] in an internship at Microsoft.

- (2018) I won the Undergraduate Paper Prize from Brown's [https://watson.brown.edu/southasia/ Center for Contemporary South Asia] for a paper about the rapper M.I.A that I wrote for a course with Brian Horton.

- (2018) I made a visualization (*[https://rohjha.github.io/lumber/ here]*) of Washington lumber data for a paper about Kurt Cobain that I wrote for a course with [https://www.brown.edu/academics/institute-environment-society/people/details/bathsheba-demuth Bathsheba Demuth].
