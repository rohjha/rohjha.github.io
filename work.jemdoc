== Computer science research-y

- (2019-2020) I completed my [https://cs.brown.edu/research/pubs/theses/ugrad/2020/jha.rohan.pdf undergraduate thesis] with Prof. [https://cs.brown.edu/people/epavlick/ Ellie Pavlick], titled "Data augmentation and the role of hardness for feature learning in NLP." We studied (empirically with synthetic data) the tipping point when models switch from (1) learning simple rules and memorizing exceptions to those rules, to (2) learning more complex and generalizable rules. I received an Undergraduate Thesis and Research Award (UTRA) from Brown to work on this project. We presented an extended poster (*[documents/pdfs/abstract.pdf here]*) at the [https://www.nyas.org/events/2019/natural-language-dialog-and-speech-nds-symposium/ Natural Language, Dialog and Speech (NDS) Symposium] at the New York Academy of Sciences. We also submitted this work to EMNLP 2020. We're also working now on another submission on extending this work to natural language and state-of-the-art NLP models.

- (2019) I worked with Profs. [https://cs.brown.edu/people/epavlick/ Ellie Pavlick] and [https://www.brown.edu/academics/cognitive-linguistic-psychological-sciences/people/faculty/roman-feiman Roman Feiman] on simulating implicature-like phenomena with neural networks. We studied whether neural networks can predict the alternatives that listeners generate in the [https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.06807 Rational Speech Acts (RSA) model]. An in-progress repository with these models is *[https://github.com/rohjha/examples here]*.

- (2018-2019) As part of a graduate algorithms seminar with [http://cs.brown.edu/~pvaliant/ Prof. Paul Valiant], I presented the following papers with classmates: "Probabilistic encryption" by Goldwasser and Micali, "Undirected connectivity in log-space" by Reingold (slides *[documents/pdfs/pres.pdf here]*), "Learnability and the Vapnik-Chervonekis Dimension" by Blumer, et al. and "Neural Tangent Kernel" by Jacot, Gabriel, and Hongler. Miranda Christ and I also wrote summaries of "Hardness vs. randomness" by Nisan and Wigderson (*[documents/pdfs/summary1.pdf here]*), Dinur's proof of the PCP theorem (*[documents/pdfs/summary2.pdf here]*), and "A Mathematical Theory of Communication" by Shannon (*[documents/pdfs/summary3.pdf here]*), and we previously presented "Primes in P" by Agarwal, Kayal, and Saxena.

- (2018) Varun Mathur and I built a model (code *[https://github.com/vrnmthr/emocontext here]*) and wrote a short paper (*[documents/pdfs/paper.pdf here]*) for the EmoContext task at SemEval 2019, as part of a graduate course with Prof. [https://cs.brown.edu/people/epavlick/ Ellie Pavlick].

== Miscellaneous

- (2019) A classmate and I completed an analysis (*[documents/pdfs/climate.pdf here]*) of the effects of climate change on afternoon rainfall in the US for a geology course with [https://www.brown.edu/academics/institute-environment-society/people/details/jung-eun-lee Jung-Eun Lee].

- (2018) I wrote much of the battery charging logic (*[https://github.com/BrownSpaceEngineering/EQUiSatOS/blob/master/EQUiSatOS/EQUiSatOS/src/rtos_tasks/battery_charging_task.c here]*) for [https://brownspace.org/equisat/ EQUiSat], the second-cheapest satellite in history and Rhode Island's first satellite. EQUiSat is currently in orbit and is alive and well.

- (2018) I TA'd the first iteration of [https://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci0111/ "Computing Foundations: Data"] with [https://cs.brown.edu/~kfisler/ Prof. Kathi Fisler]. I had the privilege of designing course content, including labs and daily drills.

- (2018) I added "Daily Digest" notifications to [https://appcenter.ms/ App Center] in an internship at Microsoft.

- (2018) I won the Undergraduate Paper Prize from Brown's [https://watson.brown.edu/southasia/ Center for Contemporary South Asia] for a paper about the rapper M.I.A that I wrote for a course with Brian Horton.

- (2018) I made a visualization (*[https://rohjha.github.io/lumber/ here]*) of Washington lumber data for a paper about Kurt Cobain that I wrote for a course with [https://www.brown.edu/academics/institute-environment-society/people/details/bathsheba-demuth Bathsheba Demuth].
