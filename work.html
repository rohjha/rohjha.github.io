<h2>Computer science research-y</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>(2019-2020) I completed my <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/research/pubs/theses/ugrad/2020/jha.rohan.pdf">undergraduate thesis</a> with Prof. <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/people/epavlick/">Ellie Pavlick</a>, titled &ldquo;Data augmentation and the role of hardness for feature learning in NLP.&rdquo; We studied (empirically with synthetic data) the tipping point when models switch from (1) learning simple rules and memorizing exceptions to those rules, to (2) learning more complex and generalizable rules. I received an Undergraduate Thesis and Research Award (UTRA) from Brown to work on this project. We presented an extended poster (<b><a href="documents/pdfs/abstract.pdf">here</a></b>) at the <a href="https://www.nyas.org/events/2019/natural-language-dialog-and-speech-nds-symposium/">Natural Language, Dialog and Speech (NDS) Symposium</a> at the New York Academy of Sciences. We also submitted this work to EMNLP 2020. We're also working now on another submission on extending this work to natural language and state-of-the-art models like BERT.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>(2019) I worked with Profs. <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/people/epavlick/">Ellie Pavlick</a> and <a href="https://www.brown.edu/academics/cognitive-linguistic-psychological-sciences/people/faculty/roman-feiman">Roman Feiman</a> on simulating implicature-like phenomena with neural networks (including <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805">BERT</a>). We studied whether neural networks can predict the alternatives that listeners generate in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.06807">Rational Speech Acts (RSA) model</a>. An in-progress repository with these models is <b><a href="https://github.com/rohjha/examples">here</a></b>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>(2018-2019) As part of a graduate algorithms seminar with <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/~pvaliant/">Prof. Paul Valiant</a>, I presented the following papers with classmates: &ldquo;Probabilistic encryption&rdquo; by Goldwasser and Micali, &ldquo;Undirected connectivity in log-space&rdquo; by Reingold (slides <b><a href="documents/pdfs/pres.pdf">here</a></b>), &ldquo;Learnability and the Vapnik-Chervonekis Dimension&rdquo; by Blumer, et al. and &ldquo;Neural Tangent Kernel&rdquo; by Jacot, Gabriel, and Hongler. A classmate and I also wrote summaries of &ldquo;Hardness vs. randomness&rdquo; by Nisan and Wigderson (<b><a href="documents/pdfs/summary1.pdf">here</a></b>), Dinur's proof of the PCP theorem (<b><a href="documents/pdfs/summary2.pdf">here</a></b>), and &ldquo;A Mathematical Theory of Communication&rdquo; by Shannon (<b><a href="documents/pdfs/summary3.pdf">here</a></b>), and we previously presented &ldquo;Primes in P&rdquo; by Agarwal, Kayal, and Saxena.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>(2018) Varun Mathur and I built a model (code <b><a href="https://github.com/vrnmthr/emocontext">here</a></b>) and wrote a short paper (<b><a href="documents/pdfs/paper.pdf">here</a></b>) for the EmoContext task at SemEval 2019, as part of a graduate course with Prof. <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/people/epavlick/">Ellie Pavlick</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>(2019) A classmate and I completed an analysis of the effects of climate change on afternoon rainfall in the US for a geology course with <a href="https://www.brown.edu/academics/institute-environment-society/people/details/jung-eun-lee">Jung-Eun Lee</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>(2018) I wrote much of the battery charging logic (<b><a href="https://github.com/BrownSpaceEngineering/EQUiSatOS/blob/master/EQUiSatOS/EQUiSatOS/src/rtos_tasks/battery_charging_task.c">here</a></b>) for <a href="https://brownspace.org/equisat/">EQUiSat</a>, the second-cheapest satellite in history and Rhode Island's first satellite. EQUiSat is currently in orbit and is alive and well.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>(2018) I TA'd the first iteration of <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci0111/">&ldquo;Computing Foundations: Data&rdquo;</a> with <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~kfisler/">Prof. Kathi Fisler</a>. I had the privilege of designing course content, including labs and daily drills.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>(2018) I added &ldquo;Daily Digest&rdquo; notifications to <a href="https://appcenter.ms/">App Center</a> in an internship at Microsoft.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>(2018) I won the Undergraduate Paper Prize from Brown's <a href="https://watson.brown.edu/southasia/">Center for Contemporary South Asia</a> for a paper about the rapper M.I.A that I wrote for a course with Brian Horton.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>(2018) I made a visualization (<b><a href="https://rohjha.github.io/lumber/">here</a></b>) of Washington lumber data for a paper about Kurt Cobain that I wrote for a course with <a href="https://www.brown.edu/academics/institute-environment-society/people/details/bathsheba-demuth">Bathsheba Demuth</a>.</p>
